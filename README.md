# blog77
I created this blog because I made a bet with a friend of mine that I would improve my English to an IELTS score of 6.5 before the Lunar New Year in 2026.
I will write down that what I learning every day in English. It could be what I learned about English today,my thoughts after reading a passage from a book, or my daily journal.
