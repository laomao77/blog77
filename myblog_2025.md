#### 1 My January

1. ##### A bet 
   Today, I created a blog to document my English learning journey over the next year. I really want to improve my English skills. To motivate myself, I even made a bet with my friend on whether I can achieve an IELTS score of 6.5 within a year. If I pass the test, I'll reward myself with a guitar. If i don't, I'll owe my friend some money--the amount will depend on whether I take the test and whether I pass it.--January 1,2025
